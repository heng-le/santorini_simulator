# Santorini Simulator with Python (CLI)
For this project, I implemented the basic game of Santorini using object oriented programming principles. I created this game with a 5x5 grid, with workers in default starting positions. On a player's turn they indicate through the CLI which worker they wish to move, which cardinal direction they wish to move, and which cardinal direction they wish to build (from the new space).
