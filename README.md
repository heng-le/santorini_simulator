# santorini_simulator
For this project, I implemented the basic game of Santorini using Object Oriented Programming principles. 
I am  only concerned with a 5x5 grid, and I will put the workers in default starting positions, so that the players do not have to pick where to start. On a player's turn they indicate through the CLI which worker they wish to move, which cardinal direction they wish to move, and which cardinal direction they wish to build (from the new space).
